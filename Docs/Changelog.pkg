 2025-09-16   : 8.0.rc2
              - **Major Version 8.0.0**
            
                * Re-write pretty much from scratch. New design and fresh start.
                * Modern coding standards: PEP-8, PEP-257 and PEP-484 style and type annotations
                * Can now manage multiple VPNs
                * Each VPN has a number of *accounts* and each account may have multiple profiles.
                  Some profiles may be gateways (can be connected to) while others are clients
                  (connect to one or more gateways).
                * Support more use cases than earlier versions.
                * Provide walk through working examples of 3 common use cases
                * The enhancements require significant data format changes.
            
                  To make the upgrade as simple and easy as possble,
                  existing data from earlier versions can be auto migrated to
                  the new format with the *-migrate* option.
            
                * Network manipulations are now built on the *py-cidr* module.
            
                * New way to modify profiles.
            
                  The *--edit* option creates a text file. The file
                  uses standard TOML (key = value) format. Simply edit the file and then
                  use the *--merge* option to incorporate those changes.
            
                  This is simple and clean and makes it easy to modify whatever may be needed
                  in one quick edit and merge.
            
                  There are still many command line options which can be particularly helpful
                  making bulk changes.
            
                * Improved command line help.
            
                  Command line option help is now organized by category:
            
                    migrate, edit/merge, reporting, general and stored options.
            
                * Document most features including migration, importing, and
                  making modifications.
